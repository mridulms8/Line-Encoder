# Line-Encoder
A line encoder that converts the digital data to digital signals. The Line Encoding schemes used in this project are NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Differential Manchester, AMI and the Scrambling techniques used are HDB3 and B8ZS.

# Digital Data Generation
Vanilla JavaScript is used for data genration. Manacher's Algorithm is used to find the longest palindromic substring in O(N) time.

# Encoding and Scrambling
Vanilla JavaScript is used for logic writing, encoding, scrambling. For signal plotting char.js library is used. The webpage is created using HTML and CSS.

# Instructions to use the Line Encoder
Every encoding or scrambling section has two interaction fields. On the left, we have a custom input section in which the user can enter any valid boolean (Digital signal of form 1 or 0) and it will be treated as input.
On the right, we have a Random Input Generator in which we can input the minimum number of consecutive zeros we must have in our randomly generated input. Next we have Generate buttons which on click will enter the input accordingly and we have an encoded signal in the form of the chart and the Longest Palindromic Substring of the data elements.
